Plant Disease Ditection System

After cloning the repository, update the dataset directory path in the "Plant.py" file to match the correct location on your system.

For example:
C:\Users\<your_username>\Plant-Disease-Detection-System\plant_dataset

Here, the plant_dataset folder contains both train and valid subfolders.

Once the path is set correctly, run Plant.py, and the script will execute successfully.
